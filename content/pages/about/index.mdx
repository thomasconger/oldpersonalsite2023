I'm Tom Conger, and I'm a Full Stack Software Engineer with a background in strategy and operations. I've run a non-profit, was the first employee at a VC-backed legal-tech startup, and have presented research on organizational change at the Pentagon.

Right now, I live in San Francisco, but I was born and raised just outside of D.C. and went to college at the University of Virgina. There, I studied economics and history as an Echols Scholar. Throughout all my experiences, I've learned about the ability of technology to impact people, and am proud to say that my work has saved users from years of unneccessary waiting, directly contributed to millions in raised capital, and brought a few, delightful smiles to my users faces.
