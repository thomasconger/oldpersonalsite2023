I'm Tom Conger, and I'm passionate about income inequality and consumer welfare. I've run a non-profit, was the first employee at a VC-backed legal-tech startup, and have presented research on organizational change at the Pentagon.

I live in San Francisco, but I was born and raised in Alexandria, Virginia which is just outside of D.C., and my parents are from Texas.
